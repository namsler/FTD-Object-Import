# FTD-Parse

This is best used on the ASA files that do not have names. Additionally, there is a module to remove objects from the FMC. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS! This was designed to remove all objects within a category. (ie, host, network, url). This includes any objects that are in use on other firewalls. 

It is recommended to run the script using a test FMC VM prior to running it on the production VM.
